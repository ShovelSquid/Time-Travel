Added .js and .html files to our repo
Started to copy over code from out succesful jsfiddle for drawing sprites on the page, stretched and rotating
Our next step is building a tilemap engine which we'll use as the base for our game
Also installed jquery, still not sure how to make it do the thing yet, but we'll get there
