I created the repo and Reed added me to the JS Fiddle document that we are using. I created a backlog, however it is currently unfinished.
The JS Fiddle thing we are using is just a sandbox for expirementation as of the moment

Until next class, I'm going to finish the backlog and do some basic polishing, such as adding an avatar to my JS Fiddle account

Reed and I need to figure out how to properly use JS Fiddle with React so that we can make a website

## 190416

I started watching the tutorial for making the tilemap editor.

For next class, I'm going to watch more tutorials and add content to the tilemap editor branch.

I need to actually watch the videos

## 190422

I created a prototype for movement, able to move with arrow keys or WASD

For next class, I need to work on greater fluid movement and making it better

Animation in JS is difficult

## 190425

I might have accidentally deleted my daily report for last class during the great purging, but I rewrote it

I made the map bigger for movement, now we have 41 x 41 tiles in total.

I've been thinking, for the tiles, about doing an array of arrays. Each value in the array dictates the tile it is, and then based on that value an image is represented on the screen.

I want to get started on working on that

## 190501

Reed and I spent most of class trying to parse values from many lists into a function, however at the end of class we learnt the truth of mapping in arrays. It is beautiful.

Next class, we are going to get the images on the screen.

## 190503

We were able to obtain information on our map stuff

By next class, I need to create 100 divs in the HTML to be able to alter.

Fun times.

IT WORKS

Riley!
IT WORKS
Now we have a basic map!
Tiles are now in the right place!
we still need to add collision and replace the backgrounds with images
feels good man

## 190513

Last night I added images to the html
I merged the experimental move branch back into master
Now we have to figure out how to beat the beast that is collision
Maybe we can do it, if the position of the player is going to be equal to that of the wall, then it won't let the image move

## 190514

We achieved more enlightenment today
Collision has just been figured out
There was some weirdness, we could collide with walls but not with floors before
But now it works!
I don't know what we're going to start doing for next class.
Probably we're going to start working on multiple maps, or adding interactability.

Exciting!
