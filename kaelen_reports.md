# Reports

## 190412

I created the repo and Reed added me to the JS Fiddle document that we are using. I created a backlog, however it is currently unfinished.
The JS Fiddle thing we are using is just a sandbox for expirementation as of the moment

Until next class, I'm going to finish the backlog and do some basic polishing, such as adding an avatar to my JS Fiddle account

Reed and I need to figure out how to properly use JS Fiddle with React so that we can make a website

## 190416

I started watching the tutorial for making the tilemap editor.

For next class, I'm going to watch more tutorials and add content to the tilemap editor branch.

I need to actually watch the videos

## 190422

I created a prototype for movement, able to move with arrow keys or WASD

For next class, I need to work on greater fluid movement and making it better

Animation in JS is difficult

## 190425

I might have accidentally deleted my daily report for last class during the great purging, but I rewrote it

I made the map bigger for movement, now we have 41 x 41 tiles in total.

I've been thinking, for the tiles, about doing an array of arrays. Each value in the array dictates the tile it is, and then based on that value an image is represented on the screen.

I want to get started on working on that

## 190501

Reed and I spent most of class trying to parse values from many lists into a function, however at the end of class we learnt the truth of mapping in arrays. It is beautiful.

Next class, we are going to get the images on the screen.
