# Reports

## 190412

I created the repo and Reed added me to the JS Fiddle document that we are using. I created a backlog, however it is currently unfinished.
The JS Fiddle thing we are using is just a sandbox for expirementation as of the moment

Until next class, I'm going to finish the backlog and do some basic polishing, such as adding an avatar to my JS Fiddle account

Reed and I need to figure out how to properly use JS Fiddle with React so that we can make a website

## 190416

I started watching the tutorial for making the tilemap editor.

For next class, I'm going to watch more tutorials and add content to the tilemap editor branch.

I need to actually watch the videos
