Working on a collaborative jsfiddle doc where I’ve created a couple sprites that can draw, stretch and rotate
We’re pretty much just experimenting at this point

## 2019 / 4 / 16
Added .js and .html files to our repo
Started to copy over code from out successful jsfiddle for drawing sprites on the page, stretched and rotating
Our next step is building a tilemap engine which we'll use as the base for our game
Also installed jquery, still not sure how to make it do the thing yet, but we'll get there

I scratched my jsfiddle and query work, kaelen found a way to make movement and borders and idk if they’ll merge
Did some research on Tiled to create our maps and processing.js to make our movement smoother

Spent the class trying to figure out how to access values through two arrays, little did we know we had constructed the arrays wrong
Now know how to access specific tiles and their corresponding values (material) which is hella helpful
Added our nice tiles to the main files

## 2019 / 5 / 3
Hark! we’ve accessed the VALUES
It was glorious, we finally got 100 iterations of 3 numbers for each 1 or 0 value on our list of lists
Next step is to get an image and coordinate values for each tile using these numbers

We created the 100 divs and then deleted them all because we decided to create them in a new list of lists
We made a forEach within a forEach that creates a div for each item in our map array, we figured out how to get the different spaces on our map to know what they are (wall or floor)
We have yet to make any of our images appear within the map, but thats the next step
