Working on a collaborative jsfiddle doc where I’ve created a couple sprites that can draw, stretch and rotate
We’re pretty much just experimenting at this point

## 2019 / 4 / 16

Added .js and .html files to our repo
Started to copy over code from out successful jsfiddle for drawing sprites on the page, stretched and rotating
Our next step is building a tilemap engine which we'll use as the base for our game
Also installed jquery, still not sure how to make it do the thing yet, but we'll get there

I scratched my jsfiddle and query work, kaelen found a way to make movement and borders and idk if they’ll merge
Did some research on Tiled to create our maps and processing.js to make our movement smoother
